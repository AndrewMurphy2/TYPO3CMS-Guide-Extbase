Introduction
==========

Because TYPO3 development using piBase became less and less transparent, and 
lost a clear programming structure, TYPO3 developers began looking for a new and 
better solution for the future of the system. After looking at many frameworks in 
detail, the developers couldn't find one without any disadvantages, so the 
decision was made to develop a completely new framework: FLOW3.

FLOW3 is the basis of the newest versions of TYPO3, formerly code-named “Phoenix”. 
Because of the completely new logic behind the new framework, FLOW3 was developed 
and is maintained within the system extensions, and not as a part of the former 
TYPO3 4.x core. Maintaining the technology within the system extension environment 
enables developers to begin working with it as soon as possible. This ensures the 
rapid development of system extensions *extbase* and *fluid*, which have allowed 
Extbase extensions to be integrated to the CMS since TYPO3 4.3.
